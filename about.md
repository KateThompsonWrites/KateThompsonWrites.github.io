Kate Thompson spent much of her childhood with her nose in books, immersed in literary adventures. From an early age, she wrote and illustrated her own Picture Books, and was determined to become a children’s author (and, potentially, a detective like Nancy Drew).

However, somewhere along the way Kate got waylaid and became, instead, a solicitor, which contained disappointingly little sleuthing and a distinct lack of storytelling.

Happily, following the birth of her sons, Kate rediscovered her passion for Picture Books and writing.

She now lives by the sea and spends her days gleefully immersed in literary adventures of her own making.

Kate was awarded second place in the 2018 Writing Magazine Picture Book Competition. She is a member of the SCBWI.

Kate’s debut authored picture book, Superheroes Don’t Get Scared, will be illustrated by Clare Elsom, and published by Upside Down Books in September 2020.
