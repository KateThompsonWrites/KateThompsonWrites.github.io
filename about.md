I spent most of my childhood with my nose in books, immersed in literary adventures. From an early age, I wrote and illustrated my own picture books, and was determined to become a children’s author (while doing some Nancy Drew-esque sleuthing work on the side).

However, instead I became a solicitor, which contained disappointingly little sleuthing and a distinct lack of storytelling.

Happily, following the birth of my sons, I rediscovered my passion for picture books and writing.

I now live by the sea and spend my days gleefully immersed in literary adventures of my own making.

I was awarded second place in the 2018 Writing Magazine Picture Prize. I am a member of <a href="https://www.scbwi.org/" title="Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators">SCBWI</a>.

## Ten Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Me

1.  I am deaf in my right ear, and have been since I was 4 years old.

2.  I have a phobia of crabs, more specifically spider-crabs. Not ideal when you live by the sea!

3.  As a child and teenager my hair was so long that I could easily sit on it. I can neither confirm nor deny that I went by the codename Rapunzel!

4.  I love painting murals. I painted my first mural when I was 10 years old. I’ve since painted 4 full-room (and one ceiling) murals for my children.

5.  I won a National Art Competition when I was 10 years old. I used my prize money to buy a book of quotations, which I still treasure.

6.  I won a slogan competition run by LeCrunch Apples when I was 16 years old. The prize was a family holiday to Lapland. The slogan was, _‘I’d share my favourite LeCrunch Apple with Rudolph because… Just a munch of LeCrunch gives a glow from head to toes, not just the nose!’_

7.  I have always had big feet – it’s my secret superpower to help me swim faster!

8.  I turn the brightest shade of red when I am nervous.

9.  I hate dancing at proper parties, but love having silly dance parties at home with my children. We put on silly dance clothes and boogie away. I’m the queen of mum dancing!

10. I have a habit of doing something clumsy on my birthday. Birthday mishaps have included: slipped over in sheep poo, crashing my bike into brambles, and setting my hair on fire while blowing out my candles!
